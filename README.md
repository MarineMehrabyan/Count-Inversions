# Count-Inversions
You are given an ‘input.txt’ text file which contains integers in some order. Write a program to   compute the number of inversions in the given file, where the row of the file indicates the entry of   an array.      Assume that the input text file is named exactly as ‘input.txt’ and lies in the same directory as your   executable. It contains exactly one integer (32-bit integral type, for example, C++ int, should suffice   to hold input values) per line, and each line doesn’t have extra whitespaces (no heading or tailing   symbols). The input file also doesn’t contain blank lines.      Please test your solution using your test cases paying attention to corner cases (empty array, 1   element array, sorted array, reverse-sorted array, random array, negative and positive numbers,   etc.). You are expected to implement your program using the fast divide-and-conquer algorithm   covered during lectures as our test file will contain 100 000 integers
